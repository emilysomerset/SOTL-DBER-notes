## Source

**Kapur, M. (2008).** Productive failure. *Cognitive Science*, 32(2), 362–383.

## Summary

- Learners who attempt complex problems **before** instruction outperform those who receive instruction first.
- This is especially effective when learners have **enough prior knowledge** to engage with the problem, even if they don’t succeed.

## Key Quotes

> "The very process of failure seems to prepare the mind for learning."

## Reflection {.callout-reflection}

This challenges my instinct to scaffold heavily. Could I try this in intro stats when I teach hypothesis testing?
