## Source

**Kapur, M. (2008).** Productive failure. *Cognitive Science*, 32(2), 362–383.

## Summary

-   Learners who attempt complex problems **before** instruction outperform those who receive instruction first.
-   This is especially effective when learners have **enough prior knowledge** to engage with the problem, even if they don’t succeed.
-   Contrasts with traditional scaffolding-first models.

## Key Quotes

> "The very process of failure seems to prepare the mind for learning."

## Reflection {.callout-reflection}

This paper really challenges my instinct to scaffold heavily before asking students to problem-solve. I wonder how this could work in stats ed — maybe as a warm-up activity before introducing a new method?
