    "text": "Summary\n\nStudy population:\n\nThe study involved students studying marketing in Melbourne, Australia. \n\nResearch question(s): This paper had two primary objectives:\n\nTo explore whether students’ use of generative AI (GenAI) is influenced by their goal orientations, and\nTo assess how students’ use of GenAI impacts their learning outcomes     \n\nMethods:  \n\nA quasi-experimental approach was adopted, as ethical considerations prevented exposing one group to GenAI while withholding it from another.\nIn Week 1, students used GenAI to generate a definition of a concept relevant to their course. After completing the 12-week unit, they wrote their own definition, compared it with the AI-generated one, and reflected on their learning.\nApproximately 75,000 words of student responses were analyzed using quantitative content analysis (QCA), which combined a qualitative coding framework with quantitative analyses applied after coding.\nThe coding framework captured broad themes [and more specific codes]:\n\nWhether GenAI use aligned with a mastery goal structure [constructive approach or augmenting knowledge] or a performance goal structure [regurgitating knowledge or procedural approach]\nTypes of learning outcomes [information literacy,…]\nTypes of thinking capability [applied knowledge, critical thinking,…]\n\nFinal unit marks (%) and assignment marks (%) were used as indicators of student learning, both for the GenAI task and overall unit performance.\n\nSelected results:\n\nIn total, 198 students from three universities were enrolled in the study: 56 and 84 students in two undergraduate units, and 58 in a postgraduate unit.\nSix students did not complete the study, resulting in a final sample of 192 students included in the analysis.\nStudents who used a constructive approach scored higher on both the assignment and the overall unit compared to those who did not (mean differences of 6.2%, p &lt; 0.05, and 5.5%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively).\nStudents who used a procedural approach scored lower on both the assignment and the overall unit compared to those who did not (mean differences of –6.2%, p &lt; 0.05, and –5.6%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively).\n\nSelected practical implications:\n\nDesign assessments that ask students to compare and contrast GenAI responses with their own.\nEncourage students to reflect on how they collaborated with GenAI to reach their answers.\nSuch assessments help students connect GenAI output to course content, develop reasoning skills, and recognize how GenAI (as a more knowledgeable source) can support learning within their zone of proximal development."

    "text": "Reflection\n\nIt would be helpful to clarify what qualifies this study as a quasi-experiment, as the distinction between treatment and control conditions, typical of experimental designs, is not immediately apparent.\nWhile using grades as a proxy for learning is common in educational research, it does come with limitations. The study could be strengthened by incorporating established assessment instruments or published tasks and rubrics specifically designed to evaluate learning outcomes.\nIt appears that assignment grades were likely influenced by how well students critically compared their own definitions with the AI-generated version, though the rubric was not included. In this context, it’s perhaps not surprising that students identified as having a mastery goal orientation received higher grades. However, because goal orientation was inferred from the same written responses that were used for grading, it becomes difficult to disentangle whether students performed better because of their goal orientation or whether higher-performing students were more likely to be categorized that way. As such, the study design may not be well positioned to isolate the impact of generative AI on learning outcomes (Objective 2), as currently framed."

    "text": "Relevant Background\n\nAchievement Goals Framework is a well-established theory in education research, often used to study academic behaviours such as cheating and to explain how positive learning outcomes are achieved. The framework posits that students adopt either performance goals and/or mastery goals in their approach to learning. Performance goal orientations emphasize demonstrating competence relative to others, focusing on grades, comparison, and external validation. While this mindset can offer short-term motivation, it often undermines deep learning and discourages students from taking intellectual risks. In contrast, mastery goal orientations prioritize the development of competence and a genuine pursuit of understanding. Students with this mindset tend to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, leading to more sustained and meaningful learning. This paper proposes that similar patterns may emerge in how students integrate generative AI into their learning, depending on their underlying goal orientation.\nZone of Proximal Development (ZPD) describes the difference between what a learner can accomplish independently and what they can achieve with guidance from a more knowledgeable person. As learners gain experience and skills, their ZPD evolves. Generative AI (GenAI) can offer tailored support within a student’s current ZPD and adjust as the learner progresses. This approach aligns with constructivist pedagogy, which emphasizes authentic, collaborative learning that challenges students within their ZPD."

    "text": "Summary\n\nStudy population: Students enrolled in an introductory programming course.\nSample: The sample consisted of 158 students enrolled during the 2023-2024 Fall Semester. This sample included 102 first-year students (54.56%) from the Department of Statistics and 56 second-year students (35.44%) from the Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology. Of the participants, 66 (41.77%) were female and 92 (58.23%) were male.\nResearch question(s):\n\nRQ1: What are the students’ profiles while interacting with AI in programming learning?\nRQ2: What is the impact of different interventions of AI integration on students’ AI interaction profiles?\nRQ3: What is the impact of previous programming knowledge on the students’ AI interaction profiles?\nRQ4: How does students’ AI interaction profiles associate with students’ performance within each intervention?\n\nMethods:\n\nStudents attended three in-person labs, each followed by a closed-book quiz designed to assess comprehension and retention of the lab content.\nThe labs implemented three distinct AI intervention strategies, applied sequentially across sessions:\n\nLab 1: Students could use ChatGPT freely, with no additional guidance.\nLab 2: Students could again use ChatGPT freely, but the session began with a tutorial on effective usage strategies and a live demonstration. (see additional background)\nLab 3: Students continued to have open access to ChatGPT, with the added support of sample prompts for each sub-task.\n\nIn a qualitative analysis of ChatGPT logs, the study identified five AI usage profiles reflecting increasing independence from generative AI (RQ1):\n\nAI-reliant code generator\nAI-reliant code generator & refiner\nAI-collaborative coder\nAI-assisted code refiner\nAI-independent coder\n\nSankey diagrams were used to visualize shifts in students’ AI usage profiles across the three sessions (RQ2).\nThe McNemar-Bowker test was used to assess within-student changes over time (RQ2).\nA one-way ANOVA was used to compare pre-test scores across different AI interaction profiles (RQ3).\nA one-way ANOVA was used to compare post-test scores across the different profiles within each intervention (RQ4).\n\nResults:\n\nThe proportion of students in the two most AI-dependent profiles rose from 49.09% in session 1 to 53.43% in session 2, then declined to 33.56% by session 3 (RQ1).\nBy session 3, students were predominantly categorized as AI-collaborative coders (RQ1).\nThe McNemar-Bowker test revealed significant within-student shifts in AI usage profiles between Session 1 and 2 (\\(\\chi^2(10, N = 135) = 34.48\\), p &lt; .001) and between Session 2 and 3 (\\(\\chi^2(10, N = 136) = 57.10\\), p &lt; .001) (RQ2).\nFrom Session 1 to 2, 51% of AI-reliant code generators shifted to also refining AI-generated code, while 35.48% of AI-independent coders began using AI for code refinement. The majority (46%) of students who already used AI to refine their code maintained this status in the second session (RQ2).\nPrior knowledge significantly influenced AI interaction profiles, with more knowledgeable students more likely to be AI-Assisted Code Refiners than AI-Reliant Code Generators (RQ3).\nReduced reliance on generative AI was positively associated with higher post-test scores, during first and seccond session (RQ4).\n\nConclusions:\n\nNotable changes in student profiles across the three sessions suggest that the AI integration strategies may have influenced how students interacted with ChatGPT.\nTransitions towards more collaborative usage of ChatGPT aligns with research on the benefits of AI literacy and prompt guidance.\nSome students moved to seeking direct answers, suggesting that training may have been outweighed by task demands.\nStudents with higher prior knowledge tend to code independently before using ChatGPT for refinement, while those with lower knowledge often rely on direct answers with minimal engagement."

    "text": "Reflection\n\nThe study by Güner and Er (2025) offers useful insights into student interactions with generative AI. One area that invites further attention is the role of prior knowledge. While students with higher pre-test scores were found to rely less on ChatGPT, this factor wasn’t accounted for in analyses linking interventions to AI usage patterns. This raises the possibility that some observed shifts, such as reduced AI reliance or improved post-test performance, may reflect existing knowledge (on the topic) rather than the interventions themselves. For instance, more knowledgeable students may naturally move toward AI independence and score higher, regardless of the intervention strategy.\nAlthough the total sample size was 158, only 146 students were categorized into AI usage profiles at each session, with some students not overlapping across sessions. The Sankey diagrams and McNemar-Bowker tests were based on subsets of 137 students (session 1 to session 2) and 136 students (session 2 to session 3), respectively.\nA noted limitation by the author is that the prompt analysis relied on ChatGPT conversation histories voluntarily submitted by students, which may not reflect all their interactions."

In line with GAISE recommendations, these students are introduced to foundational theoretical concepts and learn how to apply them to real-world data sets.\nResearch question(s):\n\nCan generative AI enable statistical data analysis even for people with little or no knowledge of statistics, at least for problems with a simpler structure?\nIf generative AI can perform a substantial portion of data analysis, what should be the future focus of statistics education? That is, what priorities should guide the design of statistics curricula?\n\nMethods:\n\nThe authors focus on analyses that can be performed using basic methods of t-test, linear regression, and ANOVA.\nFour data sets were intentionally designed to include minor violations of statistical test assumptions. For example, unequal variances across factor levels (violating ANOVA assumptions), outliers, or missing data.\nPrompts were given to ChatGPT Data Analyst as if the user had no statistical training. For example: “Please investigate statistically whether [y] differs for different levels of [x],” or “I have no statistical knowledge, can you please explain the results to me?”\nThe analyses were repeated 2–3 times for each data set to check the stability of the results.\n\nResults:\n\nChatGPT Data Analyst completed full analyses without requiring domain-specific knowledge from the user, explaining each step before implementation.\nHowever, the analyses were often incomplete. For example, issues such as heterogeneity in group variances, outliers, sample size, and missing data were not consistently addressed.\nIn only one of the three repeated analyses, ChatGPT acknowledged the need to check assumptions in a linear regression context but did not follow through.\nThe authors successfully reproduced the results using the Python code generated by ChatGPT.\n\nConclusions:\n\nReliable use of ChatGPT for data analysis requires some statistical knowledge to formulate effective prompts and identify missing steps.\nLess emphasis may be needed on programming, as AI can support code generation; instead, teaching can focus on using AI tools effectively.\nCore statistical concepts should still be taught to help students assess the completeness of results.\nClear guidelines are needed on if and how ChatGPT may be used in assessments."

While the stability checks demonstrate that it can assess application requirements, this ability was not consistently observed across iterations. This raises challenges for users with limited statistical background, as they may not be equipped to recognize potential issues in the output.\nThe suggestion that “teachers can incorporate exercises that encourage students to code more efficiently and accurately with the assistance of AI” is compelling. It would be valuable to see concrete examples or sample activities that illustrate how this idea could be implemented in practice.\nThe authors acknowledge as a limitation that the prompts were designed under the assumption that users have no statistical knowledge, while also noting that it’s unclear whether this reflects real-world usage. Since the examples were artificially constructed, future work could usefully explore how students or analysts actually engage with ChatGPT and what their completed analyses look like in authentic settings."

    "text": "Summary\n\nStudy population: Computer science undergraduate students in the winter term 2021.\nResearch question(s):\n\nDo undergraduate students who participate in Embedded Ethics modules report that the modules achieved the pedagogical goals set out in Section 3?\n\nG1: to strongly connect ethics instruction to course content\nG2: to create an environment in which students feel safe sharing their opinions\nG3: to make ethics modules an enjoyable and positive experience\nG4: to generate enthusiasm for learning more about ethics in tech\n\nDo undergraduate students who participate in Embedded Ethics modules have increased interest in and self-efficacy towards ethical issues in technology?\n\nMethods:\n\nCases: Delivered two embedded ethics modules (weeks 8 and 12) in a CS2 course intended for computer science majors.\nControls: Students in a difference CS2 did not receive embedded ethics modules\nEmbedded modules design:\n\nTopic chose was COVID-19 Contact tracing as it raises the ethical concern related to trade-offs between privacy and protecting public health, while relating to course content (e.g. algorithms)\nTo realize G2, students were asked to advocate for the viewpoint of an assigned stakeholder (e.g. health professionals, individuals whom privacy was paramount) \nFlipped class design with a low-stakes writing activity worth 1% towards their course grade.\n\nData: Students completed surveys at the start and end of the study. Each survey included six questions measuring their interest in and confidence with ethical issues in technology. These questions were combined into a single scale (maximum score: 42), with higher scores reflecting greater interest and self-efficacy in dealing with ethical issues. The initial survey also collected demographic information. For students in the treatment group, the post-survey included additional questions about the learning modules. These were combined into a pedagogical scale (maximum score: 25), with higher scores reflecting greater success in meeting pedagogical goals (G1–G4).\n\nResults:\n\nSample: A total of 842 students participated (consented), with 217 in the treatment group and 624 in the control group.\n\nThe control group included a higher proportion of women (38%) compared to the treatment group (24%), p &lt; 0.001.\nA greater percentage of first-generation post-secondary students were in the control group (15%) than in the treatment group (6%), p &lt; 0.001.\n\nInstrument’s internal consistency: TThe ethics scale showed strong internal consistency at both time points, with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86 on the pre-test and 0.90 on the post-test. The pedagogical scale also demonstrated strong reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.81.\nInitial ethics survey: There was no significant difference in the mean baseline ethics survey scores between the treatment group (M = 28.14, SD = 6.08) and the control group (M = 27.87, SD = 6.89), p = 0.53.\nPost ethics survey: There was a significant difference in the mean interest and self-efficacy towards ethics scores between the treatment group (M = 32.39, SD = 5.87) and the control group (M = 28.21, SD = 7.15), p &lt; 0.001.\nPedagogical survey: Mean scores were high (M = 20.20) and the distribution of scores were left-skewed. Each pedagogical goal was examined individually, with results indicating that all goals were achieved.\n\nConclusions:\n\nModules were associated with increased students’ mean level of interest in ethical issues and self-efficacy in dealing with ethical issues.\nA limitation of the study is that students were not randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, and demographic differences existed between the groups.\nAnother limitation is the reliance on self-reported data.\nFuture work could explore a broader range of ethics topics and assess students’ ability to identify ethical issues in specific scenarios."

Teach students how, not what to think 2) Encourage ethics-informed design choices as a design principle 3) Make discussions safe - not personal\n\n\n“Technology is shaping our future. Let’s educate our students to incorporate ethical considerations in the design of that future.”"
