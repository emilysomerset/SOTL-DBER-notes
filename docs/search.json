    "text": "Summary\n\nStudy population:\n\nThe study involved students studying marketing in Melbourne, Australia. \nIn total, 198 students from three universities were enrolled in the study: 56 and 84 students in two undergraduate units, and 58 in a postgraduate unit.\nSix students did not complete the study, resulting in a final sample of 192 students included in the analysis.\n\nResearch question(s): This paper had two primary objectives:\n\nTo explore whether students’ use of generative AI (GenAI) is influenced by their goal orientations, and\nTo assess how students’ use of GenAI impacts their learning outcomes     \n\nMethods:  \n\nA quasi-experimental approach was adopted, as ethical considerations prevented exposing one group to GenAI while withholding it from another.\nIn Week 1, students used GenAI to generate a definition of a concept relevant to their course. After completing the 12-week unit, they wrote their own definition, compared it with the AI-generated one, and reflected on their learning.\nApproximately 75,000 words of student responses were analyzed using quantitative content analysis (QCA), which combined a qualitative coding framework with quantitative analyses applied after coding.\nThe coding framework captured broad themes [and more specific codes]:\n\nWhether GenAI use aligned with a mastery goal structure [constructive approach or augmenting knowledge] or a performance goal structure [regurgitating knowledge or procedural approach]\nTypes of learning outcomes [information literacy,…]\nTypes of thinking capability [applied knowledge, critical thinking,…]\n\nFinal unit marks (%) and assignment marks (%) were used as indicators of student learning, both for the GenAI task and overall unit performance.\n\nSelected results:\n\nStudents who used a constructive approach scored higher on both the assignment and the overall unit compared to those who did not (mean differences of 6.2%, p &lt; 0.05, and 5.5%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively).\nStudents who used a procedural approach scored lower on both the assignment and the overall unit compared to those who did not (mean differences of –6.2%, p &lt; 0.05, and –5.6%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively).\n\nSelected practical implications:\n\nDesign assessments that ask students to compare and contrast GenAI responses with their own.\nEncourage students to reflect on how they collaborated with GenAI to reach their answers.\nSuch assessments help students connect GenAI output to course content, develop reasoning skills, and recognize how GenAI (as a more knowledgeable source) can support learning within their zone of proximal development."

    "text": "Reflection\n\nIt is unclear what makes this study a quasi-experiment, as it is not evident what the treatment or control groups would have been in a true experimental design.\nUsing grades as a measure of learning in a research setting has limitations. It would strengthen the study if the authors incorporated established assessment instruments or published questions and rubrics that are specifically designed to evaluate learning outcomes.\nAssignment grades are likely based on how well students critically evaluated differences between their own definition and the AI-generated one (the rubric was not provided). Given this, it’s unsurprising that students classified as having a mastery goal orientation received higher marks. The students are grouped into goal orientation categories based on their written responses and those same responses are also used to determine their grades. It’s unclear whether students with a certain goal orientation tend to perform better, or whether their higher performance simply led to them being placed in that category. This makes it hard to draw any clear cause-and-effect conclusions. Therefore, based on my understanding, this study design is not able to assess the impact of GenAI on learning outcomes (study objective 2)."

    "section": "Relevant Background",
    "text": "Relevant Background\n\nAchievement Goals Framework is a well-established theory in education research, often used to study academic behaviours such as cheating and to explain how positive learning outcomes are achieved. The framework posits that students adopt either performance goals and/or mastery goals in their approach to learning. Performance goal orientations emphasize demonstrating competence relative to others, focusing on grades, comparison, and external validation. While this mindset can offer short-term motivation, it often undermines deep learning and discourages students from taking intellectual risks. In contrast, mastery goal orientations prioritize the development of competence and a genuine pursuit of understanding. Students with this mindset tend to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, leading to more sustained and meaningful learning. This paper proposes that similar patterns may emerge in how students integrate generative AI into their learning, depending on their underlying goal orientation.\nZone of Proximal Development (ZPD) describes the difference between what a learner can accomplish independently and what they can achieve with guidance from a more knowledgeable person. As learners gain experience and skills, their ZPD evolves. Generative AI (GenAI) can offer tailored support within a student’s current ZPD and adjust as the learner progresses. This approach aligns with constructivist pedagogy, which emphasizes authentic, collaborative learning that challenges students within their ZPD."

    "text": "Summary\n\nStudy population: Students who are not pursuing careers as data analysts or data scientists. For example, those studying social sciences or business administration. In line with GAISE recommendations, these students are introduced to foundational theoretical concepts and learn how to apply them to real-world data sets.\nResearch question(s):\n\nCan generative AI enable statistical data analysis even for people with little or no knowledge of statistics, at least for problems with a simpler structure?\nIf generative AI can perform a substantial portion of data analysis, what should be the future focus of statistics education? That is, what priorities should guide the design of statistics curricula?\n\nMethods:\n\nThe authors focus on analyses that can be performed using basic methods of t-test, linear regression, and ANOVA.\nFour data sets were intentionally designed to include minor violations of statistical test assumptions. For example, unequal variances across factor levels (violating ANOVA assumptions), outliers, or missing data.\nPrompts were given to ChatGPT Data Analyst as if the user had no statistical training. For example: “Please investigate statistically whether [y] differs for different levels of [x],” or “I have no statistical knowledge, can you please explain the results to me?”\nThe analyses were repeated 2–3 times for each data set to check the stability of the results.\n\nResults:\n\nChatGPT Data Analyst completed full analyses without requiring domain-specific knowledge from the user, explaining each step before implementation.\nHowever, the analyses were often incomplete. For example, issues such as heterogeneity in group variances, outliers, sample size, and missing data were not consistently addressed.\nIn only one of the three repeated analyses, ChatGPT acknowledged the need to check assumptions in a linear regression context but did not follow through.\nThe authors successfully reproduced the results using the Python code generated by ChatGPT.\n\nConclusions:\n\nReliable use of ChatGPT for data analysis requires some statistical knowledge to formulate effective prompts and identify missing steps.\nLess emphasis may be needed on programming, as AI can support code generation; instead, teaching can focus on using AI tools effectively.\nCore statistical concepts should still be taught to help students assess the completeness of results.\nClear guidelines are needed on if and how ChatGPT may be used in assessments."

The stability checks show it can assess application requirements, yet it does not do so consistently across iterations. This is a limitation for users with little knowledge of statistics, as they would not be able to recognize the limitations of the results.\nThe suggestion that “teachers can incorporate exercises that encourage students to code more efficiently and accurately with the assistance of AI” is interesting. I would like to see concrete examples of how this can be implemented.\nThe authors note as a limitation that prompts were designed assuming users had no statistical knowledge. However, they acknowledge that it’s unclear whether this reflects how real users actually interact with AI. Additionally, since these examples were artificially generated, it remains to be studied how students or analysts genuinely use ChatGPT and what their final analysis outcomes look like."
